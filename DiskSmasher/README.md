# DiskSmasher

## Open-Source implementation of scanning script for visualizing drive consumption. 

## Script origins:
This script is an open-source version of a proprietary disk scanning script I built. It has also been written from scratch and does not modify settings (only scans). 

## How to use the script:
1) Run PowerShell as an Administrator.
2) Run `Get-Help ./DiskSmasher -Detailed`.
